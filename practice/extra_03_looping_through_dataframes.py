# ==========================
# LOOPING THROUGH DATAFRAMES
# ==========================

'''
OVERVIEW
--------
You can loop through columns and rows of a DataFrame. If you are looping so
that you can update a value in the DataFrame, I'd recommend just seeing if you
can use .iloc or .loc to update a value since that is more computationally 
efficient.

import pandas as pd

dancers_dict = {
    "Type" : ["Ballet", "Jazz", "Modern", "Tap", "Tango", "Square", "Hip-Hop"],
    "Dancer" : ["Jane", "Hadley", "Lyla", "London", "Zoey", "Millie", "Beck"],
    "Age" : [18, 23, 19, 20, 21, 22, 21]
}

df_dancers = pd.DataFrame(dancers_dict)
print(df_dancers, "\n")

# 1. LOOP THROUGH COLUMN NAMES
# If you don't specify anything it gives you the column names.
# Try printing out all the column names in a loop.


# 2. GET ROW VALUES OF A SPECIFIC COLUMN
# You can also just loop through a specific column. Try printing out all the
# names of the dancers by looping through the "Dancer" column.


# 3. GET ROW VALUES OF ALL COLUMNS
# Try combining the above two loops to loop through everything.


# 4. USE .iterrows() TO DIRECTLY GET EACH ROW
# iterrows(): gives you an index and the whole row. Notice how it doesn't have
# an "_" like .iter_rows() from openpyxl.
# try printing out each individual column of each row.
