Practice Problem: Managing a Classroom with Pandas

You are given a task to manage a classroom's score record using Pandas.
The class has 5 students and they have scores in three subjects:
Math, English, and Science. 
'''

students_dict = {
    "Names" : ["Frank", "Jacob", "James", "Alice", "Emily"],
    "Math" : [45, 56, 78, 88, 99],
    "English" : [90, 87, 99, 99, 23],
    "Science" : [12, 56, 98, 44, 55]
}

# PART 1:
# Convert the dictionary to a Pandas DataFrame and print it out.


# PART 2:
# - Print the Math scores of all students.
# - Print the name and scores of all subjects of the third student.


# PART 3:
# - Update the English score of the first student to 75.
# - Update the Science score of the last student to 85.


# PART 4:
# Add 10 to the Math scores of all students
